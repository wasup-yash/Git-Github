Don't be afraid to raise and issue if you found a bug and or a feature that you can add in a project .... and its also better to raise issue first before creating 
a pull req to the branch .
You can comment to ask questions regarding a perticular question related to project in an organised issue that is already created or else you can raise the issue and 
get it clarifies from the maintainers .
